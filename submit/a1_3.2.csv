"As the amount of data increases, the overall classification accuracy increases. Assuming the model is sufficiently defined and the added data is representative, this result is expected because additional data mitigates overfitting. By exposing the model to a larger representation of the population (smaller samples may contain noise or fail to capture patterns), the model is more likely to learn structure as opposed to just memorizing outcomes; in machine learning, we refer to this as reducing variance (sensitivity to noise) which enables the model to generalize better.
