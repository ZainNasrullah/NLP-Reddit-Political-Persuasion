The best model (AdaBoost) is shown to be significantly better than all other models within a confidence level of 5%. This is probably because each score across folds in the best classifier exceeds that of every other classifier by a fair margin. In particular, models with low standard deviation across folds received very low p-values (less than 1%) since the test is more confident in their scores and thus the signifcance between models. Models with higher variability received relatively higher p-values (though still low) as there is more uncertainty associated with them.
